Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? They don’t call me Long John because my head is so big. So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality.

Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. How much does the pirate pay for an ear piercing? … A buccaneer! (buck- in- ear…) Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew.

I’d love to drop anchor in your lagoon. Pardon me, but would ya mind if I fired me cannon through your porthole? Prepare to be boarded. Let’s get together and haul some keel. So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” you know, thats the 2nd time I’v watched that man sail away with my ship. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her.

Let’s get together and haul some keel. Take what you can, give nothing back Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate.

STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!!! The average man will bristle if you say his father was dishonest, but he will brag a little if he discovers that his great- grandfather was a pirate. Life’s pretty good, and why wouldn’t it be? I’m a pirate, after all. If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” Damnation seize my soul if I give you quarters, or take any from you.

Take what you can, give nothing back Yarrrr! there be ony two ranks of leader amongst us pirates! Captain and if your really notorious then it’s Cap’n! Work like a captain, play like a pirate. Shiver me timbers. A pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever. Well actualy piracy is a democracy with captains voted for by the crew. Piracy – Hostile take over. Ahoy! lets trouble the water!

So, tell me, why do they call ye, “Cap’n Feathersword?” Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be pirates. “I’ve got a jar of dirt! I’ve got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” “Why is the rum always gone?” Pirate’s code: First freedom and the captain. Second the loot, third woman and the rum and at the end no mercy if they not immediately surrender! Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant?  Arrrrbys!

If ye thinks he be ready to sail a beauty, ye better be willin’ to sink with her. It is when pirates count their booty that they become mere thieves. Land was created to provide a place for boats to visit.

You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? Give me freedom or give me the rope. For I shall not take the shackles that subjugate the poor to uphold the rich. Where there is a sea there are pirates. The average man will bristle if you say his father was dishonest, but he will brag a little if he discovers that his great- grandfather was a pirate. Merchant and pirate were for a long period one and the same person. Even today mercantile morality is really nothing but a refinement of piratical morality.
