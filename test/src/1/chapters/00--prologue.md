That’s the finest pirate booty I’ve ever laid eyes on. C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Suddenly you’re like a pirate, you’re 65 years old and you’ve got an ear- ring. A pirate is a man that is weak to achieve but too strong to steal from even the greatest achiever. Whats a pirate’s favorite fast food restaurant?  Arrrrbys!

Have ya ever met a man with a real yardarm? You’re drinking a Salty Dog? How’d you like to try the real thing? That’s some treasure chest you’ve got there. That’s quite a cutlass ye got thar, what ye need is a good scabbard! C’mon, lad, shiver me timbers! Why are pirates pirates? cuz they arrrrrr STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!!!

Yes, that is a hornpipe in my pocket and I am happy to see you. Brwaack! Polly want a cracker? … Oh, wait. That’s for Talk Like a PARROT Day. Aye, I guarantee ye, I’ve had a twenty percent decrease in me “lice ratio!” Always be yourself, unless you can be a pirate. Then always be a pirate. STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!!! Where there is a sea there are pirates.
